# Introduction #

Game for Euro 2012.

> You are a football (soccer) fan. ME too :p. Long time ago, I was addicted to Champion League Manager game series then find my self spend every nights and days to play it. Not to mention Pro Evolution Soccer and kick the ball in real life… Anyway, my motivation of making a clone of all my Sport games I love is simple, I want to experiments the things I learnt when I play that game, and pretend to be a player, a coach, a manager… for once in my life. So let's make it real!
